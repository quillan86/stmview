% ColEdit colormap editor toolbox
% Version 1.0  20-Mar-1998
%
% Ever wanted to create your own colormap without explicitly handling
% arrays of RGB-values ?  
% ColEdit is an easy to use graphical user interface to create your
% own colormaps. Colormaps can be saved to m-files and be reloaded
% when written with ColEdit. Import of plain ASCII arrays of rgb-values
% is also possible.
